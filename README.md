# Portal-Backend
Backend part of Portal Editor.

## Development mode
For we're using AP to locate specific files currently, if you want to do some testing things, it is strongly recommended to run this backend part on our remote server.

Please contact Donggu to get server info.

Or, please create folder /root/kevinz and clone this backend into it. You also have to create a folder named 'portals' in folder 'kevinz'.

- Ensure you've installed node, and your node version is over v6.4.0.
- Step in /root/kevinz/Portal-Backend and run
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Then
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
- After this the server will run. You can test it via atom or postman/websocketest, etc.
